These logos are found on most SDS and XDS documents.  The XDS version
was found on a "punch card" during the conversion of the Users Group
library.  There was on tape, binary card images of character information.
I wrote a program to convert this to a readable form without having to
punch it and the above image would not convert.

<CENTER>Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, and SDS</CENTER><P>&#160;<P>

Snow White (IBM) and the seven dwarfs (RCA, Univac, GE, Honeywell,
CDC, Burroughs, and NCR) had all emerged in the computer industry before
SDS was formed in 1961.  (DEC was formed in 1959 just prior to SDS.)
SDS had about 1% of the total computer market when it was acquired by
Xerox in 1969 to become XDS.

<BLOCKQUOTE>If anyone wanted to advance XDS to dwarf status when first
GE [1970] and later RCA [1971] withdrew from the computer industry
nobody said so.  The references after those withdrawals were rather
"and then there were six," and later, "and then there were five."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Xerox withdrew from the mainframe computer industry on July 21, 1975 --
never quite achieving dwarfdom.<P>

In spite of the rough path that users of SDS and XDS computer
equipment have had, many are still seeking equipment that will meet their
needs.  The future is bright before us.  Options other than Big Blue 
(and others such as DEC), Honeywell CP-6, and Telefile are emerging.
Our past is slowly being forgotten -- even unknown to many, in many of our sites.
At present the computer equipment moves from place to place as management,
personnel, and the constraints (demand, space, time, and money) on the
computing resources change.<P>

Why is the equipment still in service almost 20 years after it was 
designed?  How will the real-time applications cope?  What is to become
of the tremendous software investment?<P>

<CENTER>SDS and the 24 (12) Bit Computers</CENTER>&#160;<P>

SDS was founded in September 1961 by Max Palevsky (President) and
eleven other computer scientists.  Their first computers, the SDS 910 and
920 were delivered in August 1962 (within 1 year of forming!) and included
the following features new to the industry:<P>

<OL>
<LI>) The only small GP with an extensive but separate I/O system<BR>
<LI>) Programmed OPerations (POPs).
</OL>

"The first commercial computer with all silicon semiconductors ever
delivered by any manufacturer was the SDS 910."<P>

Emil Borgers (Manager of Programming, later a Vice President, and a
founder) stressed that the hardware and software were designed together
as a package.  The sale price included "the most efficient and comprehensive
software package in the small computer field."  The software included:
utility programs, assembly programs, mathematical subroutines, and FORTRAN
II.  FORTRAN II was a subset of the 900-series FORTRAN compiler.  The SDS
920 was "the only computer that, without magnetic tape units, can process
FORTRAN II programs in one pass."<P>

Advertised first users included: JPL, Bell Labs, NASA, Motorola, GE, 
Honeywell, RCA, Dow Chemical Company, Edwards Air Force Base, and Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory.<P>

The SDS 910 and 920 were initially advertised as "half the price of"
or alternately "worth twice as much as" "comparable machines." Later the 
SDS 9300 was advertised as twice as fast and one quarter the price of 
a[n IBM] 7090.<P>

The SDS 9300 was announced in June 1963. SDS was not yet two years<P>

<P><HR><P>

old, announcing its third computer, and in the black.  The SDS 9300 is
logically and electrically similar to the 920 with which it is program and
peripheral compatible.  Optional features include: priority interrupts (up
to 1024 channels), and floating point arithmetic.  Up to eight buffered I/O
channels are available. The 32 K-word address space is divided into 2 
parts with a program controlled select switch to determine which of the
halves is connected.  Memory protect registers are available.  It is 
designed for scientific computations and integration in real-time
simulation and telemetry systems.<P>

By December 1963, SDS claimed more than 75 installations of SDS 910s 
and 920s when it announced the SDS 930, it's fourth computer.<P>

By August 1964, SDS announced the SDS 925 and SDS 92.  The next month
brought the "new 930" evidently about 12% faster than the original.  The
SDS 92 was "the first commercial computer to make extensive use of
monolithic integrated circuits."  ICs were used on about one half of the
100 circuit cards.<P>

By February 1966, SDS announced the SDS 940, a time-sharing system
which was backward compatible with the previous systems (except the SDS 92
which was a 12 bit computer).  It had monitor and user modes, dynamic
program relocation, automatic memory fragmentation, and system protection.
"You'll still be contented using your 940 system five years from now" - was
advertised in 1966.  Today (1984) SDS 940s still run Tymshare's Tymnet and
Comshare uses at least two.  The University of California at Berkeley 
worked with Tymshare and SDS on this early time-sharing system.<P>

In 1968 the SDS 945 was advertised as an SDS 940 with less
expandibility but just as much compute power.  The design of the SDS 940 is
very complex because of the backward compatibility with the 930 etc. and
the needed changes to support time-sharing.  The design of the Sigma 7 can
readily be seen as a simplification and extension.<P>

    Block  3-bit virtual maps to 5-bit physical block number
    
    Fixed point data is in two's complement form (bit 0 sign).
    
    Floating point is 24 or 39 bit mantissa with 9 bit exponent.

Most documentation tents to be in octal for these machines.  This is
readily understandable when you realize 24 is divisible by 3 and the
opcode is aligned such that it ends at bit 8.<P>

<CENTER>The 16-bit Sigma and Xerox Computers</CENTER>&#160;<P>

SDS delivered the Sigma 2 in December 1966, the same month as the
Sigma 7.  It is based on the same circuit card series, similar memory,
and interchangeable peripherals.  The T series integrated circuit module
family combines monolithic DTL integrated circuits: flip-flops, inverters,
and buffer amplifiers with close tolerance, discrete diode-resistor gates and
output pull-up resistors.<P>

The Sigma 3 was first delivered in 1969 and made the Sigma 2
"obsolete".  It has greater I/O capabilities and more maintenance features.<P>

The Xerox 530 was announced in January 1973 and delivered in July 1973.
It replaces both the Sigma 2 and the Sigma 3.  The software is
upward compatible.<P>

The 16-bit processors use one- or two-word instructions.  Most of the
instructions are one-word types consisting of a 4-bit operation code,
a 4-bit address control field, and an 8-bit address field.<P>

The floating point instructions are controlled by a bit in the PSD.
The processors can run protected (master/slave).  There is a set of
16 16-bit write protect registers, 2 condition codes (overflow, carry),
and 2 interrupt inhibit bits (internal, external).<P>

I know of no efforts being made to produce a computer that is software
compatible with the Sigma/Xerox 16-bit processors.<P>

<CENTER>The 32-bit Sigma and Xerox Computers</CENTER>&#160;<P>

The SDS Sigma 7 was the first 32-bit computer which SDS produced.  SDS
claimed that it was the only computer (then available) to handle <U>all</U>
computer applications effectively (i.e. Scientific, Commercial, and Real-time).
It was announced March 15, 1966, delivered yet that year (on-time)
and was hailed as ambitious in the literature.  It's major competition was
the IBM 360 - with which it shares many similarities (announced April 7,
1964, 360/40 delivered May 1965).<P>

The SDS Sigma 5 with no decimal, map, or byte-string instructions was
delivered one year later for both real-time and time-sharing use.<P>

The next item is not a computer but a new name for the company.  Xerox
and SDS agreed to a merger in March 1969.  It was voted on by the
shareholders May 15, 1969.  One share of Xerox common stock would be
exchanged for each two shares of SDS common stock.  SDS was then considered
by some to be the eighth largest computer manufacturer.  Xerox's stock
was reported worth $930 million, whereas SDS's stock was worth $30.7 million.
Others state the sales price as $908 million.  At that time SDS had
installed over 1000 computers, a large percentage of which were either
Sigma series or 940's.<P>

The Xerox Sigma 6 was next.  It is a Sigma 7 CPU with redesigned
memory and IOPs which include a maintenance feature.  It has many items
standard which were optional on the Sigma 7.  This brought XDS into the
business marketplace whereas SDS had concentrated on the neglected
scientific community.  Supposedly its name (distinct from Sigma 7) was
necessitated because of some foreign marketing arrangement SDS made with<P>

<CENTER>11</CENTER>
<P><HR><P>

CII of France.  Any further Information on this would be appreciated.<P>

The Xerox Sigma 9 followed.  It is the most powerful of the Sigma
series.  It was the first to overcome the physical equal to virtual address
space limitation.  The two instruction look-ahead contributed to its speed
increase.  It was developed with multi-processing in mind and contains more
maintenance features in an integrated manner than the Sigma 6.  Walter
Hollingsworth has been called by some the father of the Sigma 9.<P>

The Xerox Sigma 8 and Sigma 9 mod 3 were primarily update paths for Sigma 
5 users.  (There was also a Sigma 9 mod 2.)<P>

The Xerox 550 and 560 were a total repackaging with big boards, newer
technology and less space.  The Xerox withdrawal from the mainframe
industry had it primary effect on users of these machines because of the
dissimilarity of the hardware and the small number built.  Taurus is a code
name for this series.<P>

At the time of Xerox's departure from the computer field they had
about 1700 computers install in the U.S. and 400 abroad.  They agreed to
provide support for its customers for at least seven years.  Parts which
were considered salable were the rights to CP-V, the installed user base,
the service operation, and manufacturing rights to some of all of XDS'
computers.  Orders were at record levels.  The XDS 550 and 560 were being
well received.  Getting even more favorable attention was the CP-V
operating system, called one of the world's five fully versatile operating
systems.  During 1976 Xerox and Honeywell worked together to provide user
support. Now in 1984 all maintenance contracts are expired and Honeywell is
not renewing them, forcing uses to abandon Honeywell or convert to CP-6.<P>

CII of France seems to have produced Sigma compatible computers
specifically Iris 80, perhaps others in the early 1970's.<P>

Project Leo or the Xerox 590 was a yet to be announced product,
technologically similar to the Taurus, but more powerful.<P>

<CENTER>12</CENTER>
<P><HR><P>

Honeywell announced it was building Sigma 9's in the late 70's early
80's, but I have no production figures.<P>

Between 1980 and 1982 Modutest built and sold ten "Mod 9's"-Sigma 9
equivalents.  They also supplied the materials for five more which
Comshare built.<P>

Sigma 7, serial number one was running in March of 1984 at the Cyclotron
lab, Michigan State University, Lansing Michigan.  The original hand-wired
backplanes have been replaced with machine wrapped ones under Honeywell.
It has since been sold - perhaps for scrap (particularly gold).<P>

Numbers two and three were at Martin Marietta, Denver Aerospace Division.
They suffered water damage early in their careers.<P>

Telefile's T-85 was the first Sigma replacement available.  It was up
running CP-V the first time on Oct 24, 1979.  It was available for
demonstration near the June 1980 Exchange meeting in Philadelphia.  Martin
Marietta, Denver Aerospace Division Beta test sited it in February 1981.
The T-85 is micro-programmed and can emulate the instruction set of all
the 32-bit Sigma computers.  In addition, the instruction set has been
expanded to provide new instructions (logical immediates, queue, quad, and
environment), to expand the versatility and speed.  Telefile is committed
to developing an operating system to make better use of multiple
processors.  Due to the micro-programming, different algorithms are used to
perform various instructions, which can produce different intermediate
results.  Since some instructions can be interrupted this can be
problematic in a mixed CPU multiprocessing environment.  The T-85 series was
developed to be quite interchangeable with the Sigma computers.  As a
result the memories, I/O processors and peripherals are usable on the Sigma
series.<P>&#160;<P>

Ilene Industries Data Systems is nearing completion on a Sigma
replacement: the MOD 9000.  Production preparation and Beta-test siting at
NASA Huntsville should be complete in fourth quarter 1984.  The MOD 9000
contains logical immediate, quad precision floating point, and other
instructions in addition to the standard Sigma 9 instruction set. The MOD
9000 hardware is different enough so that the CPU, memory, and I/O
processors must all be replaced together, although provision is made to

<CENTER>15</CENTER>
<P><HR><P>

make use of existing peripherals.  IBM peripherals will be compatible also.
The MOD 9000 combines some microcoding with fixed hardware design using
Multiwire printed circuit boards.<P>&#160;<P>

Realtime Computer Equipment Inc. has begun work on a Sigma
replacement: the RCE-9.  Beta-test site times could not be determined.  It
will be piecewise replaceable with the Sigma computers (CPU, memory, I/O
processors), and will contain provision to support IBM peripherals.  It
will make extensive use of the Sigma 9 logic struction using programmable
Logic Arrays.<P>&#160;<P>

Although these processors are backward compatible with the Sigma 9,
there are substantial differences, with each manufacturer going in a
slightly different direction.

UTS - Universal Time-Sharing System<P>&#160;<P>

The Universal time-sharing system (UTS), announced in 1966 as a
multipurpose system that would, in effect, be all things to all people,
encountered numerous delays before its release to the field. BTM was
developed as an interim system.  UTS was delivered early in 1971, primarily
as a time-sharing system.  It evolved through eight versions and numerous
enhancements into a true multi-purpose operating system with batch, remote
batch, interactive time-sharing, and terminal oriented inquiry/response
(TP) capabilities.<P>

CP-V replaced UTS and XOS in mid-1973.  It culminated Xerox's efforts
to develop a comprehensive, multi-purpose operating system for the Sigma 6
and Sigma 9 computers.  CP-V was based on the earlier UTS operating system,
and supported five modes of operation:

Honeywell's answer to Sigma computer users was CP-6, a new operating
system very similar to CP-V but running on Honeywell hardware.  Science
Dynamics was the first customer in late 1978, delivery was expected in mid
1979, and production use by early 1980.  Today Honeywell has about 45 user
sites, mainly the larger Universities which were using Sigmas. Shell Klee
directed the software development effort.<P>

Chicago, Houston, and New York.  In 1984 they are running a total of 52
Sigma 9's at 4 sites (Ann Arbor(24), London(20), Canada(6), Japan(2)) as
dual processors (i.e. 26 systems).<P>

Telefile was founded in 1968.  The rights to the name Telefile were 
purchased from Bunker-Ramo which once produced a computer by that name
(Teleregister Telefile, late 1957).<P>

In 1977 Telefile billed

<BLOCKQUOTE>
itself as a computer enhancenment company, dedicated to
prolonging the useful life of older cpu's whose speed and

<CENTER>25</CENTER>
<P><HR><P>

efficientcy never were fully tapped before they were effectively
obsoleted by their manufacturers in one way or another.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1975 Telefile attempted to purchase manufacturing rights to some or
all of the XDS's computers.  Sam Edens, president got only "frustration and
dismay" in the attempt to negotiate with XDS.  The plan in November was

<BLOCKQUOTE>
to purchase the entire lease base and all maintenance contracts 
on our own, directly from the users.  The following rates
applied:<BR>
<PRE>
     Sigma 3,5  up to 55% of purchase price
     Sigma 6    "  "  66% "  "        "
     Sigma 7    "  "  77% "  "        "

     Xerox 550,560 "  73% "  "        "
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Telefile produced several models of TCP-16, an emulator for Lockheed's
MAC-16 (LEC-16).<P>

In November 1977, Datamation wrote that Telefile's TCP-32 a Sigma 9-like
computer scheduled for delivery in late 1978.  In August 1978 the name
of the new computer was Phoenix.  A Sigma 9 followon hd been billed Sigma
11, but "Sigma" had been tied up for 10 years by Sigma Instruments,
Telefile had long manufactured a line of Xerox-compatible peripherals.

<CENTER><U>Valcomp</U></CENTER><P>

John Cool joined SDS at age 22, starting up field engineering and 
directed it for five years.  Years later in late 1971 after getting out of
school, he purchased a one-third interest in and became president of, a
computer maintenance company called Valcomp (formerly Valley computer)
headquartered in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.  Valcomp's specialty was
assuring long operating life for process control computer systems.<P>

SDS would not submit nor comment on production and installation figures
for their computers.  In February 1969 <U>Computers</U> <U>and</U> <U>Automation</U> published a
table of estimates for total installed SDS computers.  This table was used
with little modification until August 1974 when they published their last
computer census.  Evidently little effort was made to update their figures.<P>

I understand that after the Honeywell take-over, Sigma 9 CPU
backplanes were discovered in the Phoenix warehouse.  Any help as to the
number manufactured for any SDS/Sigma/Xerox (and compatible) computers
would be greatly appreciated. [Note: I understand California had an excessive
inventory tax which is why so many companies had offices in Phoenix.]
